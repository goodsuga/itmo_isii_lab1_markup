Fed Up,2016-11-04T19:40:00.000+02:00,breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information  percentfedupcom,"breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed 
they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained 
i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found 
so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated 
so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges 
the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons 
prince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials 
listen to interview here 
the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect hillary clinton to prevent any real justice from being done he warned 
as for the mayor of new york city prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this 
the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

EdJenner,2016-11-10T02:37:06.677+02:00,not kidding colleges give students safe spaces to cry over trump winthreaten students over protrump chalkings,"email for republican politicians like ohio governor john kasich who refused to get behind donald j trumpit turns out trump was righthe didnt need you in spite of the massive media force who came out against him and the never trumpers from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him if obama was running against donald j trump today trump would have beaten him 
its easy to glance at tuesdays popular vote  which with  percent of all precincts reporting shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in   and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base but the truth is much more complicated while she underperformed relative to obamas  totals in several midwestern states  ohio michigan iowa and wisconsin  clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania north carolina virginia nevada and new hampshire whats more she far surpassed obamas  vote total in florida the countrys biggest swing state yet somehow while obama carried florida clinton lost it which brings us to an important question was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday or does he deserve far more credit could he for instance have competed with the vaunted obama machine the answer somewhat shockingly is yes 
a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump  would have defeated obama  in the electoral college disclaimer this obviously is an applestooranges exercise because no two elections are the same nor are any two electorates still unlike debating whether the  cubs would defeat the  yankees this is not an entirely abstract argument a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical headtohead matchup the math might seem impossible after all obama won nearly  million votes in  trump is currently at  million and should finish around  million which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won how then could trump have topped obama in the electoral college the answer republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states lets look at them individually in descending order by population and do the electoralvote math the  totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported

robert de niro gave antidonald trump protesters across the united states his backing friday as he spoke about how depressed the tycoons win in the presidential election had made him 
the yearold star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film the comedian in los angeles when he was asked how he was coping with trumps victory over democratic rival hillary clinton 
how am i doing im very depressed the famously laconic raging bull actor told reporters 
we have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government 
asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of tuesdays election he replied yes absolutely things arent being done right 
demonstrators took to the streets in miami los angeles new york and other us cities for a third straight night on friday 
in manhattan they held signs reading your wall cant stand in our way  a reference to the antiimmigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the us border with mexico 
de niro hasnt minced his words in his criticism of trump describing him as a punk a pig and an idiot 
id like to punch him in the face he said before the election 
earlier in the day a town in southern italy where de niros grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape 
if after the disappointment of trump he wants to take refuge here we are ready to welcome him said antonio cerio the mayor of ferrazzano

okay lets address this hillary might win the popular vote isnt that electoral college situation just awful thing head on 
no its not awful its great and it protects the importance of your vote its also uniquely american and demonstrates yet again the onceincreation brilliance of the founding fathers 
first of all shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast she may win the number of votes counted but not the votes cast 
states dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference if there is a margin of  votes counted and there are  absentee ballots outstanding then the state tabulates those if the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results then the absentee ballots arent counted 
who votes by absentee ballot students overseas the military businesspeople on trips etc the historical breakout for absentee ballots is about  republican in  when al gore won the popular vote nationally by  votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder there were  million absentee ballots in california alone a  breakout of those yields a  to million republican vote advantage so bush would have gotten a vote margin from californias uncounted absentee ballots alone so much for gores  popular vote victory that was the headline on the ny times and it was the lead story on nbc nightly news right no youre kidding 
getting back to the win the popular votelose the electoral college scenario thank gd we have that or else california and ny would determine every election every time 
but the electoral college brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say as do madison ave execs and factory workers in tennessee

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press

they had to know they had it coming 
donald trump scolded media big shots during an offtherecord trump tower sitdown on monday sources told the post 
it was like a fing firing squad one source said of the encounter 
trump started with cnn chief jeff zucker and said i hate your network everyone at cnn is a liar and you should be ashamed  the source said 
the meeting was a total disaster the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration but instead they got a trumpstyle dressing down the source added 
a second source confirmed the fireworks 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about  or  people including the big news anchors from all the networks the other source said 
trump kept saying were in a room of liars the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest deceitful liars he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar and cnn was a network of liars the source said 
trump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room 
the stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a trump administration 
cbs good morning cohost gayle king did not stand up but asked some question how do you propose we the media work with you chuck todd asked some pretty pointed questions david muir asked how are you going to cope living in dc while your family is in nyc it was a horrible meeting 
heres a sampling of trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before he won the election in a landslide in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down 
trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway told reporters the gathering went well 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks she said during a gaggle in the lobby of trump tower pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days 
the meeting was off the record meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations 
the hourlong session included top execs from network and cable news channels among the attendees were nbcs deborah turness lester holt and chuck todd abcs james goldston george stephanopoulos david muir and martha raddatz

wire reported on friday about the fbis surprising announcement that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat anthony weiners newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin computer which was subject to a seperate investigation will this really yield anything significant in the  days runningup to the nov th election or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors it seems that washingtons political tricksters have already sprung into action 
after comeys shock announcement a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere supplied to fox news  in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control 
elite circles fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton 
certainly a desperate democratic party and an even more desperate obama white house over the last  weeks obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal yesterdays fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios protect the president who is already deeply tied to the clinton email coverup democratic party machine has created a distraction to coverup latest wikileaks dump fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week 
note despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway youd think hillary would have already known that it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all its just too early to tell 
see also fbi james comey was board member of hsbc  clinton foundation  drug cartel bank of choice 
the fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was extremely careless and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state 
zero hedge adds 
now it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi although comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure needless to say all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over 
here is leaked aka just covering my ass memo from fbi director james comey 
watch this space here is a highlight reel of hillary clinton lying on at least  occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server

fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face 
it remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election

white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

Mike Rivero,2016-11-02T01:43:00.000+02:00,party corruption clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced dnc consultant,"november   by wire  comments 
patrick henningsen st century wire 
the longer this soap opera drags on its becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow 
the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools 
even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it 
it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us 
what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement 
on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans 
anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media 
you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another 
never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami 
backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive 
hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state 
but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty 
the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week 
and then down to almost nothing 
it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county 
at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack 
are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election 
behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house 
on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks 
soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response 
according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it 
image crowdstrike cyber security 
the posts nakashima then added 
the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers 
an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities 
moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov 
despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented 
likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  
still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it 
the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence 
we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing 
whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies 
air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence 
what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing 
the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda 
in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  
under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything 
to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks 
for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it 
in  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures 
this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  
jumping the shark 
after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative 
soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb 
 josh schwerin joshschwerin october   
clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing 
they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead 
either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization 
their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened 
to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton 
the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it 
party meltdown 
wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton 
 a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper 
 a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  
braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here 
 completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot 
in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage 
clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq 
 lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   
worse than watergate 
perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue 
some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president 
theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  
so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself 
what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that 
obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server 
so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it 
sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people 
on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers 
coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  
it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case 
on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports 
oh yes recall our post from last week  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik 
oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it 
russia  the party scapegoat 
former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin 
 howard dean govhowarddean october   
another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  
i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville 
maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  
these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks 
suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  
the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki 
with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about 
the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said  we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that 
whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind 
that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the  election 
on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table 
we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security 
selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era 
knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry 
still were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late

shawn helton st century wire 
the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire 
the clintons  goldman sachs 
while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid 
anointed chelsea clinton with goldman sachsbacked hedge funder marc mezvinsky 
the clinton family is chockfull of banking connections as chelsea clinton joined the avenue capital group which according to reports is a  billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many democratic party campaigns chelsea is married to marc mezvinsky  a former investment banker for goldman sachs chelseas tenure at avenue capital group was from  just prior to hillary clintons run for president in  since then chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the clinton foundation 
marc mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently eaglevale hellenic opportunity  after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of  million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk greek bank stocks and toxic government debt 
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree 
as it turns out marc is the son of troubled former congressman ed mezvinsky  another close friend of team clinton 
politico reports on one of ed mezvinskys financial controversies in  
in the waning days of clintons presidency federal prosecutors and the fbi were bearing down on former rep ed mezvinsky diowa who had fallen for a series of ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly  million money from other investors to cover his losses  
continuing politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from ed mezvinskys wife to then president bill clinton 
records released last week by the clinton presidential library in little rock and obtained by politico show mezvinsky and his thenwife  exrep marjorie margoliesmezvinsky dpa  pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case 
in  the daily mail reported the following chelsea clintons husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the greek economy and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds marc mezvinsky  and his partners former goldman sachs colleagues bennett grau and mark mallon raised million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation that fund however has lost  percent of its value investors with direct knowledge of the situation told the new york times  and will now be closed 
the insiders a groundbreaking ceremony at goldman sachs headquarters in manhattan in  hillary clinton is joined by michael bloomberg  lloyd blankfein current goldman sachs ceo former goldman sachs ceo henry paulson image source ilovemyfreedom  
the ny times further outlined the longheld clintongoldman connection just two years before the  financial crisis the clintons relationships with wall street deepened in the s when mr clinton set up his foundation in harlem and mrs clinton was elected to the senate from new york that brought her in close touch with the big wall street firms a source of jobs and tax revenue for new york  and a leading source of campaign funds for mrs clinton during her years in congress employees of goldman donated in excess of  to mrs clinton more than those of any other company except citigroup according to the center for responsive politics along with other new york politicians mrs clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate lower manhattan after the sept   attacks and those breaks helped goldman build its new roughly  billion headquarters when it broke ground in  mrs clinton and other new york officials were onsite how to monetize influence lloyd blankfein at a clinton global initiative event with hillary clinton image source sputniknews  the wall street racket to understand who powers the clinton foundations billion dollar rico influencepeddling slush fund you need to understand how money is laundered between wall street and washington dc goldman sachs jpmorgan chase morgan stanley bank of america and citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the  crash then in april of  goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for  billion dollars cnbc reported the following 
goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group 
all told the clinton friendly investment giant goldman sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the department of justice after the financial crash of  in addition the firm was ordered to pay  billion to the federal housing finance agency in   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the great recession 
in a new york review article goldman sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in  
data gathered mostly from the corporate research project  a public interest website show that on thirteen occasions between  and  goldman was penalized by us courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between  and  
cashing out bill clinton with his top economic strategist robert rubin image source st louis postdispatch  
wall street selects team clinton 
the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

this should be the biggest revelation yet from wikileaks already epic email trove will the us media cover this story 
last night in an rt exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker john pilger wikileaks editor and founder julian assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection 
wikileaks reveals an early  email where the outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton was urging john podesta  then advisor to president barack obama to bring pressure on gulf states saudi arabia and qatar which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil islamic state is isis and other radical sunni groups 
this constitutes proof that the clinton foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same gulf states which both secretary clinton and president obama knew were funding isis al nusra front al qaeda in syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations 
in addition the clintons foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies 
infographic conservative post  
this latest news validates what wire has been saying since the isis crisis began in june  
according to fox news  fbi sources have said that indictments are likely for the clinton foundation investigation one only wonders how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning 
assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation 
all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis 
during their minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript 
john pilger the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly saudi arabia 
julian assange under hillary clinton  and the clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with saudi arabia more than  billion during her tenure the total arms exports from the us doubled in dollar value 
jp of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the clinton foundation 
ja yes

yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

over the past months hillary clinton the obama white house and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that  russia is hacking the us election  blaming moscow for the wikileaks emails the dnc leaks and for allegedly hacking us voting systems despite the grand accusations no evidence or proof has been offered by the us government 
it goes without saying how damaging the democratic partys crazed witch hunt has been to usrussian relations where clinton has led the antirussian crusade and demonizing president vladimir putin at every opportunity 
todays stunning presidential victory by donald trump means that all eyes are now on putin to see how moscow and washington will be interfacing going forward 
with such sensitive geopolitical issues like syria and the ukraine currently in play what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward 
in a message to donald trump russian president vladimir putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between moscow and washington in keeping with each others views meets the interests of both russia and the us 
putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing russianamerican relations out of their current crisis 
the russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some burning issues that are currently on the international agenda and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security ria novosti reported 
on top of it putin has expressed confidence that building a constructive dialogue between moscow and washington based on principles of equality mutual respect and each others positions meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community 
according to many observers usrussia relations are now at their lowest point since the cold war putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of russias relations with the us was not our choice however 
for things to improve between moscow and washington the us should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect russias interests rather than try to dictate terms putin said last month 
we are concerned with the deterioration of russianamerican relations but that was not our choice we never wanted that on the contrary we want to have friendly relations with the us a great country and a leading economy putin said at an economic forum in moscow

antitrump street protests linked to the soros funded organization moveonorg have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the  presidential election result 
mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama 
outsider vs insider manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of trump presidency photo illustration wires shawn helton 
the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon 
washington dc  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media 
wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle  and several other cities saw protests according to usa today 
in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous 
soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon 
americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results 
hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia 
tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election 
the gatherings  organized by moveonorg and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible 
within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon 
soros agitprop empire 
last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros 
pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a  circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network 
the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement  aka ows in  as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in  along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest 
back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement 
as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage  shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away 
in a politico article in early  entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter  we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance 
major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement 
it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated  million in pac money in  and january of  soros reportedly gave  million to boost clintons campaign  soros also recently funded  million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond 
look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances 
social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news  
during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the  election 
if those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law 
paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube  
usa color revolutions 
both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective 
this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state 
inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg  as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests 
it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency 
but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why 
legal action against soros groups 
in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for  million  in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest 
the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks  million in damages 
while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang 
the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into  and beyond

we have seen soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries most recently in ukraine with the soros sponsored maidan coup 
now it looks like soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming trump presidency 
we do know thanks to wikileaks that george soros was a huge supporter of hillary clinton as hillary clinton was always looking out of george soros best interests 
we are certain trumps victory is a bitter pill for globalist soros to swallow between putin and trump soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter

organized efforts are underway by democratic party affiliated ngos to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this weeks us presidential election 
on the eve of the us election before voters went to the polls wire political affairs analyst patrick henningsen accurately predicted this weeks unrest when he said  
if trump wins expect the likes of soros and moveonorg to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs who will protest riot smash and burn their way on to cnns  hour news rotation expect occupy  and blacklivesmatter to rage 
on friday henningsen talked to rt international about the postelections protests that were coordinated in part by democratic party community organizing online platform moveonorg  watch 
 not surprisingly moveonorg have also launched a national activist campaign to  abolish the electoral college  after democratic candidate hillary clinton came up short with  including new hampshire to donald trumps  including arizona and michigan final totals are not yet in but thus far  would be the fifth time in us history that a presidential candidate has won the white house while losing the total popular vote

helton also raised the question as to why president obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests opting instead to lead from behind he explains

 steve feldman stevefeldman november   
therapy dogs included two golden doodles two american eskimo dogs and a beagle mix  walked around the offices of the house of representatives students at cornell university even staged a cryin on campus the day after the election 
other us campuses were organizing various theraputic activities like poetry readings where healthy snacks will be served 
the dogs were organized by ngos the human animal bond research initiative pet partners the pet leadership council and the pet industry joint advisory council 
their press release says that democratic party staffers needed the help of a nonjudgmental furry fourlegged best friend that enjoys bipartisan support

the election campaign might be over but the mainstream medias campaign against president elect donald trump is in full swing 
between all of the fake polling intentionally proclinton partisan coverage and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the clinton campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left 
its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes 
cbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off 
when told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win trump told interviewer leslie stahl  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it 
one big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes 
now its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that trump won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets 
in fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit trump and to help stoke more nationwide protests 
buzzfeed reported via religion of peace  
a woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette including one wearing a donald trump hat made up the story police said in a statement 
the woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women the advertiser reported 
lafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation the paper reported 
during the course of the investigation the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males the statement reportedly read 
note this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media 
thats right  this was just another hoax 
violent democraticaffiliated street gangs 
what leslie stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and  minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters 
here are just a few examples michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared student trump supporter attacked at woodside high school httpstcoetvvdjo 
 mama angel mommysaurus november   
watch this clip taken from the radical leftist portland protests this weekend where democratic party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a trump supporter these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveonorg  a digital platform partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip 
 here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for donald trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital 
from reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america watch this disturbing video  agitator and chief where is obama 
these incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the trump presidency 
amidst all this violence however where is the current president obama or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives its almost as if obama and clinton are enjoying the unrest most certainly though obama clinton and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage 
what used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program  minutes has gradually become a joke it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazinestyle safe segments judging by its plummeting ratings and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like anderson cooper and lesley stahl there is little hope for this institution you might even say its irredeemable  
one of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter photo left whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail trumps presidential run while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among democrats hillary clinton candidacy stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections but its too late the damage has already been done and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain they are a dirty media outlet and now everyone knows it 
now cbs news has been exposed in public view but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position twenty years ago this might have been considered shameful but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage 
none of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years

lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okeydokey 
then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective hohum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values 
this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group 
each presidential election the drill goes like this 
after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of africanamericans of women of gays etc 
this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney  john mccain and george w bush  of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president 
 in  for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that thengov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again 
 when john mccain ran in  barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one 
 in  when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them facetoface about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely africanamerican audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains 
the only difference today is that republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets",english,21stcenturywire.com,http://i0.wp.com/21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2-Trump-Stahl-60-Minutes-copy.jpg?fit=610%2C415,conspiracy,1.0,cbs minutes withheld trumps appeal stop attacking minorities ignored reports attacks trump supporters,november wire leave comment william mcgurn wall street journal lets get straight calling hillary clinton bigot reporters asking every republican sight donald trump gone far clinton campaign releases video saying mr trump candidate ku klux klan okeydokey mr trump already likened hitler mussolini stalin small wonder theres collective hohum democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump peddling kkk values democrats didnt start mr trump either years democrats portrayed gop one giant hate group presidential election drill goes like republicans nominate someone immediately finds prove hes hater africanamericans women gays etc year democrats added twist mr trump claim represents break decent lovable republicans mitt romney john mccain george w bush course isnt saying back men running president example naacp ad recreated gruesome murder james byrd imply thengov bush sympathetic lynching black men footage chain dragged pickup truck mr byrds daughter says gov george w bush refused support hatecrimes legislation like father killed john mccain ran barack obama warned republicans would scare people saying know doesnt look like presidents dollar bills mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama playing race card bottom deck funny thing reporters always hearing dog whistles republicans somehow didnt hear one mitt romney went naacp told facetoface opposition obamacare stories really trolling racist vote vice president joe biden put explicitly telling largely africanamerican audience mr romney win hed put yall back chains difference today republicans nominee giving good gets

the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media

a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

Mike Rivero,2016-11-24T03:37:00.000+02:00,hillary clinton supporters now calling for a recount of votes in battleground states,"while richard spencers halfjoke of hailing donald trump with r oman salute rose a lot of dust some remarks in his npi speech point into rather sinister direction a posthuman one 
transcript with references and additional av material 
undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger 
however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  
in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun 
this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists 
however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement 
the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos 
in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  

triumph of the will or hipster babylon working 

in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will  we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality  
it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic 
well start our explanation with lesser weirdness 
meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works 
well it works because it is magical 

chaos magick 

here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  
therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs 
the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet 
the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  
there are many interesting implications to this 
the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  
in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick 
trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other 
in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group 
so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness 


we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek 
well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic 
namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless 
it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek 
a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification 
however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum 
one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs 
every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard 
with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on 
since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated 
out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general 
and a god was born  source  

synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction 
namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality 
i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos 

posthuman traditionalism 

i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  
in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends 
the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for 
well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name 
so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail

if there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the eus super bureaucratic class those doubts can finally be put to rest this week it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing 
the new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis see full report below the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values  the new antirussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antirussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy a touch oxymoronic isnt it 
eu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy 
no wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer 
the cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters contributors and pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for goebbels hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good they are simply unable to do authentic journalism or speak truth to power  incredibly instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime ideologues in brussels want to attack rt 
the faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington paris and london who are still hellbent on keeping antirussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine  to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond and the eus migrant crisis debacle and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy underpinned by a backward and confused ideology 
we tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure see the following video and written report by rt international 
 rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda 
the eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday commenting on the vote 
putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues 
 the best approach is an open discussion in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented  putin said 
adding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work 
in the wednesday vote  meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties  with  voting against it and  abstaining 
written by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists ecr group anna fotyga the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth provoke doubt divide the eu and its north american partners paralyze the decisionmaking process discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens  
the report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states causing disintegration within the bloc 
at the same time russia is accused of  information warfare  with such entities as rt tv channel sputnik news agency rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir russian world fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools  
the document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state is formerly isisisil 
the report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values  
it called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived russian propaganda threat by means of  investing in awareness raising education online and local media  it also suggests stronger cooperation between the eu and nato  on strategic communication  
sputnik has already appealed to the un the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and a number of international journalists organizations and ngos including reporters without borders to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the eu 
 the resolution hits straight at a number of respected media including sputnik agency and has an aim to stop their activity in the eu moreover the resolution bluntly contradicts the eus own human rights and freedom of press norms reads the letter signed by sputnik editorinchief margarita simonyan 
during the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote meps campaigning for the resolution said the eu was  at war with russia on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter

No Author,2016-11-25T02:49:00.000+02:00,eu red scare brussels passes new resolution to counter russian media propaganda," share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency ap photo  dennis system 
columbus oh ap  history was made today in columbus ohio when more than  million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than  million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november 
the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about  amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee 
the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process 
over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of  timothy  we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way 
according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote 
the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models 
the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision 
i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent 
most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late 
during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price 
though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose  of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses 
it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way

Jimmy Rustling,2016-10-27T13:00:00.000+03:00,the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump mathematically guaranteeing him a presidential victory  abc news," share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december th ap photo  dennis system 
washington dc ap  following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order   which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december  th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically 
people all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump 
under the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take  days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec  th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college 
not surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision 
crooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right 
the president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college 
we have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary 
paul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election 
most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than  votes  but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the  electors who meet in their respective states on december  th  what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them 
political analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether 
the electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in  but so did the three fifths compromise  everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the  st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare 
obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward 
were going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

by charles c johnson  comments  
give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

why bill clintons  trips on the lolita express child rape jet matter may    
daniel greenfield   
we dont know what bill clinton did or didnt do in company with jeffrey epstein but we certainly know what epstein did and almost as outrageously what he got away with doing  

some of the most shocking allegations against epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an fbi probe in civil suits brought by his victims for example the claim that three yearold french girls were delivered to him as a birthday present but the feds did identify roughly  young women most of them underage at the time who described being lured to epsteins palm beach home on the pretense of giving a massage for money then pressured into various sex acts as well as the balkan sex slave epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just  more recently a big cash payment from mail on sunday coaxed one of epsteins main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy this victim virginia roberts produced a photo of herself with prince andrew in  and reported that epstein paid her  to meet the prince then  years old she claims that she was abused by epstein and loaned to his friends from the age of  

sex crimes of the kind roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of  to  years in federal prison yet when all was said and done epstein served his scant yearplusonemonth in a private wing of the palm beach jail and was granted a hourperday free pass to leave the premises for work 

in short epstein was never actually in jail during his house arrest he flew around the country on his jets from his new york city place to his private island at least one of epsteins victims claimed to have met bill clinton and it turns out that bill clinton was a much more regular passenger on the lolita express 

former president bill clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least  trips aboard the lolita express  even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by foxnewscom 

clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls 

it doesnt help that the democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting epstein a pass on child rape that bill clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money 

either way weve come a long way from gary hart being bounced for monkey business to bill clinton flying around on a child rapists plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it 

social conservatives often get a bad rap but there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window what did bill clinton actually do who knows more importantly these days who cares 

about daniel greenfield 

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 

for sure defence counsel have made much of taylors involvement with the missing and murdered women all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac the real killer whats not in dispute is that taylor is one scary character  streethardened menacing a procurer of prostitutes lured to the pickton farm contemptuous of both sextrade workers especially street walkers and drug addicts 

shes pure evil says one outreach worker who asked that her name not be used in any story about taylor 

 

court has heard that taylors dna was found on  items retrieved from the pickton property  including handcuffs condoms clothing syringes  and also on items that belonged to some victims  brenda wolfes lipstick mona wilsons rosary 

one witness pickton pal pat casanova told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as angel whod been brought to the farm by taylor he said he gave the money to taylor who shared some of it with angel 

another witness gina houston put taylor on the same bed with victim sereena abotsway in picktons trailer 

in his lengthy police interview pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with taylor 

on the stand houston recounted a conversation shed had with pickton about taylor shortly before his arrest 

willie told me that he believed she taylor would do the right thing when she came back that she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for

jeff wells points to other odd things 

a week or so ago a man called steve remian committed suicidebycop but the name steve remian surfaced at the robert willie pickton murder trial in new westminster bc last march when jurors were told that remians name  with a burnaby bc address  was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in picktons workshop 

in april jurors heard further evidence that dna testing on two hairs found on a hudsons bay blanket removed from picktons motorhome linked one to pickton and the other to a steve remian 

a source involved in the oakville shooting investigation told the star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in oakville but had been acquitted although a coaccused was convicted 

source 

it does seem like a regular hive of activity robert picktons pig farm was a constant buzz of activity with people and vehicles coming and going all the time a woman who lived in picktons trailer for a time testified on wednesday 

tanya carr  told the jury in picktons murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the port coquitlam bc farm and it wasnt unusual for people to show up late at night looking for pickton or his brother dave 

source 

also there are those hells angels and the piggy palace 

it was a rough crowd at piggys palace said brian a musician who played there a few years ago with the hardrock band south city slam 

the nightclub he said was inside an old building on a property dave pickton and his brother robert own at  burns rd near their pig farm on dominion road in port coquitlam 

even the women were tough looking  a lot of leather and denim it wasnt a cocktailgown kind of place  he recalled 

brian who didnt want his last name used recalled that there was a coatcheck girl and a sign saying check your knives and other weapons at the door  

the crowd at piggys palace often included men wearing hells angels biker club colours 

they were there a lot said brian the people who came all seemed to know one another  

super serco bulldozes ahead

serco has come a long way since the s when it ran the fourminute warning system to alert the nation to a ballistic missile attack 

today its bn order book is bigger than many countries defence budgets it is bidding for a further bn worth of contracts and sees bn of opportunities 

profit growth is less ballistic the firsthalf pretax surplus rose  to m net profits just  to m stripping out goodwill the rise was  with dividends up  to p 

serco runs the docklands light railway five uk prisons airport radar and forest bulldozers in florida  

 serco farewell to npl after  years of innovation  january  serco said goodbye to the national physical laboratory npl at the end of december  after  years of extraordinary innovation and science that has seen the establishment build a worldleading reputation and deliver billions of pounds of benefit for the uk economy during that period under serco s management and leadership npl has delivered an extraordinary variety and breadth of accomplishments for the uks economy and industry some of the key achievements during that time have been it has been estimated that work carried out by the centre of carbon measurement at npl will save eight million tonnes of carbon emissions reductions  of uk footprint and over half a billion pounds in economic benefit over the next decade npls caesium fountain atomic clock is accurate to  second in  million years and npl is playing a key role in introducing rigour to high frequency trading for serco s front running banks in the city through npl zulu time 

uk cabinet office  emergency planning college  serco types of exercise workshop exercises these are structured discussion events where participants can explore issues in a less pressurised environment they are an ideal way of developing solutions procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making table top exercises these involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line either in realtime or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas the participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise tabletop exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations commandcontrol post exercises these are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems feeling lucky punk  this could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support the gold standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan such exercises also test information flow communications equipment procedures decision making and coordination live exercises these can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a fullscale rehearsal they are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with highrisk situations they are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with command post exercises as part of a wider exercising package  

christopher rajendran hyman cbe born  july  in durban south africa was chief executive of serco group plc from  to october   on graduation he worked for arthur andersen in  he won an month exchange with ernst  young in london who employed him after four months head hunted in  by serco  hyman became european finance director and in  was made group finance director in  hyman became chief executive  hyman resigned from his role of chief executive of serco on  october  following allegations that serco had overcharged government customers  he was making a presentation to serco shareholder including british and saudi governments on the th floor of the world trade center north tower at the time of the september  attacks in  

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

hiring spree seeks pornpeddler others 

in an unrelated starnet matter the vancouverbased internet gambling and pornography company appears eager to mount a new hiring spree recruiting staff in numerous positions including its porn division which it hopes to quickly sell off

queasy websurfers may want to take a pass on these sites at least redlightcom which offers a much hardercore home page than starnets main porn sites sizzlercom and chiselcom redlightcoms home page offers an extremely explicit mix of teaser shots including a graphic livesex video clip while starnet wants to dump its porn business its latest ad seeks a marketer to maintain continual market research of new forms of advertising and demographics with overall participation in the team effort the thursday recruitment ad came three days after starnets monday disclosure that it hopes to quickly auction off its adult entertainment division assets with documentation to be complete in  days 

this redlightcom site happens to be the same starnet site targeted by the police in their proposed single criminal count of adult pornography while no charges have yet been laid against starnet or any directors or employees the information to obtain a courtfiled document supporting the search warrant notes eight proposed counts including one of possession for the purpose of publication distribution or circulation computerized pictures depicting obscene acts the police note that fetish one of redlightcoms seven sections shows  images of nude bondage women with clamps on body parts women with horse bridles and bits in their mouths and women hanging by their arms from straps or belts 

the latest starnet recruitment ad also suggests it is business as usual at starnet despite the weekago raid by more than  officers from the rcmp cleu the ontario provincial police the united states customs service and the us internal revenue service 

the georgia straight ad seeks a worldbroadcastscom manager an internet marketing manager html programmers graphic designers an investor relations administrative assistant an adminstrative assistant of production and sports odds analysts starnet seeks openminded innovative people who enjoy working in a dynamic fun team atmosphere and are able to work creatively under pressure 

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october    
by charles c johnson  comments  
give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information 

stay tuned for more

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

the case of the vanishing visa files  
december    pm pst  
by chuck goudie   
december   chicago  potentially important evidence has disappeared in a terrorism case involving two chicago men their visa records vanished from chicagos indian consulate it comes one week after the abc  iteam raised questions about how david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place 

the case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from mumbai to michigan avenue indias foreign secretary nirupama rao told reporters overseas wednesday that she wants answers from chicagos indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared records that might show how two accused chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in india 

top officials of chicagos india consulate wouldnt talk to the iteam on camera last week when asked how terror suspects david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained fiveyear unlimited passage visas to india 

and the consul general did not return calls wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process headley and ranas visas which indian foreign secretary nirupama rao announced wednesday have disappeared 

wednesday evening the chicago consul general emailed a statement to the iteam that conflicted with government statements made in india the brief statement read we have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to david coleman headley and tahawwur rana hussain relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the government of india 

indias counterpart to the fbi is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the  mumbai massacre 

the two chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault rana was denied bond by a chicago district judge tuesday despite family members and friends offering  million in cash and property rana has not been directly charged with the mumbai attack that left  dead but was linked to the assault in government court filings 

headley a pakistanborn chicagoan is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was daood giliani he changed his name to ease travel to india according to federal prosecutors in chicago and to avoid the required previsa background check by indian authorities 

since the time headley and rani were processed indias chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called travisa outsourcing that on its website claims we have revolutionized the way people get their visas 

and the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year 

the advantages of outsourcing is the travisa company which is handling the outsourcing has set up a call center said ashok kumar attri consul general 

foreign secretary rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the us has given to indian investigators headley and rana are not due back in court until january

james fulford quotes politico 

michelle obamas senior year thesis at princeton university obtained exclusively from the campaign by politico  shows a document written by a young woman grappling with a society in which a black princeton alumnus might only be allowed to remain on the periphery read the full thesis here part   part   part   part   michelle obama thesis was on racial divide  jeffrey ressner  politicocom 

sidley austin likely recognized this in michelle even if she didnt show them her princeton thesis who better at sidley austin to be mentor to the author of this princeton thesis than bernardine dohrn who had been number  on the fbi most wanted list 

barack obama was assigned to michelle obama in summer  this may have reflected how few blacks there were at sidley austin especially from harvard law school or the equivalent dohrn got her jd from university of chicago law school since she is a prof at northwestern despite her background we might infer she was very smart and understanding so she was the perfect person to be the mentor for michelle obama at sidley austin

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

benghazi consulate attackers used militarystyle tactics say us officials  
experts still unsure whether assault that killed  americans in libya could have been prevented  
by matt apuzzo and kimberly dozier   
september    am  washington ap  the heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the us consulate in libya used militarystyle tactics that may have steered americans toward a waiting ambush us officials said friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun 

us intelligence indicates that  or more people many of them masked were responsible for the sept  assault on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi gun trucks provided added firepower the attackers set up a perimeter controlling access in and out of the compound a first wave of attacks sent the americans fleeing to a fallback building where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire 

intelligence reports were still coming in but officials told the associated press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an antiislam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation 

in a country coming off a civil war a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance how much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions officials said 

the attacks killed ambassador chris stevens diplomat sean smith and two former navy seals who us officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials stevens was visiting benghazi from tripoli to preside over the opening of an american space cultural center 

the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports they stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in benghazi fbi agents from new york and washington were in libya investigating the attack 

what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack secretary of state hillary clinton said friday and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four americans 

officials have not singled out one responsible group but have focused their attention on ansar alshariah a libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the us militaryrun prison in guantanamo bay cuba 

since the civil war that ousted libyan dictator moammar gadhafi last year the country has been awash with rebels militias and terrorists weaponry is easy to come by both from the former regime from weapons depots looted during the war and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion the origin of the weapons used in the assault on the us compound was unclear officials said

abstract  
a fullsize mortar training device which includes fullsize simulated propelling charges is disclosed both  mm and  mm mortar training devices are disclosed the device provides realistic training on virtually all aspects of mortar firing the device allows training in target sight acquisition and mortar positioning elevation and azimuth sight reacquisition due to recoil dropping a round adjusting the number of charges as required to achieve a desired zone of firing distance adjusting the projectile fuse setting to control time of explosion provides realistic firing sound and allows trainees to follow procedures similar to those used with standard mortar service ammunition the device includes a cartridge projectile which contacts a pad within and at the lowermost point of the mortar barrel which is not propelled from the mortar barrel and which provides data to a computer system to determine if an area or object would have been impacted by the mortar projectile provides analysis of trainee firing errors and provides for the simulation to be replayed for trainee instructional and other purposes the  mm device includes a handheld firing option and the  mm device includes a blast attenuator device to further enhance the realism of the simulation

an angry john podesta issues a statement on reopening of fbi probe   
by tyler durden   
oct    pm while hillary has yet to address todays stunning letter by fbi director comey who reported that the federal bureau of investigations has opened a probe into hillary clintons email as a result of findings on what the nyt reported was an electronic device belonging to anthony wiener a clearly angry john podesta clintons recently hacked campaign chair issued the following statement in response to fbi letter to gop congressional chairmen 

in response to the letter sent by fbi director james convey to eight republican committee chairman in congress hillary for america chair john podesta released the following statement friday 

upon completing this investigation more than three months ago fbi director comet declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call in the months since donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly secondguessing the fbi and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clintons presidential campaign 

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october    
by charles c johnson  comments  
give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

christopher rajendran hyman cbe born  july  in durban south africa was chief executive of serco group plc from  to october   on graduation he worked for arthur andersen in  he won an month exchange with ernst  young in london who employed him after four months head hunted in  by serco  hyman became european finance director and in  was made group finance director in  hyman became chief executive  hyman resigned from his role of chief executive of serco on  october  following allegations that serco had overcharged government customers  he was making a presentation to serco shareholder including british and saudi governments on the th floor of the world trade center north tower at the time of the september  attacks in  

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program
